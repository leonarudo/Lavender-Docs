The Handler will always be called every time your furniture gets loaded in SavableScriptableObject.LoadFromPath(). Scripts added to your prefabs directly in the furniture creation or AssetBundle are likely causing errors, so always add your scripts using this handler! Example using Lavender.FurnitureLib; // This Handler function gets called every time your furniture gets loaded!
